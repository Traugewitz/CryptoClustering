# CryptoClustering
Module 11 Challenge
In this Challenge, We our understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Specifically, we examine price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.

Prepare the Data:
We used StandardScaler from scikitr-learn to normalize our csv data.

We then found the best value for k using the original scaled data.
We used K-Means and plotted the clusters.

We then optimized our data with PCA and determined the weight of each feature on each principal component.
